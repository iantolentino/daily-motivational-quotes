Of course. The original list used fictional, archetypal authors to create a specific "Studio Ghibli" and wisdom-quote aesthetic. Here is a recreated list where every quote is attributed to its real-life author or historical figure.

I've kept the spirit of the original quotes but matched them to the actual person who said something similar in meaning.
